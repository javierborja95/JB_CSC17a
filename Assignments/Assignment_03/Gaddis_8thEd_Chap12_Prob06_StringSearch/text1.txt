Leaves of Grass
Walt Whitman
To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's
  elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-
  married couple, and the fruits of orchards and
  flowers of gardens,
To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass
  through,
To carry buildings and streets with you afterward where-
  ever you go,
To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you
  encounter them, to gather the love out of their
  hearts.
To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that
  you leave them behind you,
To know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as
  roads for traveling souls.

All parts away for the progress of souls,
All religion, all solid things, arts, governments--all
  that was or is apparent upon this globe or any globe,
  falls into niches and corners before the procession
  of souls along the grand roads of the universe.

Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the
  grand roads of the universe, all other progress is
  the needed emblem and sustenance.

Forever alive, forever forward,
Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent,
  feeble, dissatisfied,
Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected
  by men,
They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not
  where they go,
But I know that they go toward the best--toward something great.
